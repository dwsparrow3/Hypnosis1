        <h2>What are some of the possibilities?  Click below and explore!</h2><br>
        <h3>Reading a script yourself and following the directions</h3><br><br>
        <p class="negativeMargin">The first gallery is a short collection of scripts in order, designed to create only a relaxed state of mind and body.  If you happen to drowse into trance, fear not; there are only two possible outcomes.  You fall into a normal sleep, or you wake up.  This option is mostly free, unless you pay for a script to download and follow instead.  Those can be $2.00 - $5.00.</p><br>
        
        <h3>Attending a hypnosis show</h3><br><br>
        <p class="negativeMargin">This is a fun and comedic way to experience being in trance, but you might not be picked as one of the subjects.  Typically, these hypnotists will ONLY choose those people who fall into trance in 2-6 seconds, as they can move the show along quickly.  Unfortunately, these shows are the most talked about, and are where the stigma that "I can't be hypnotized" originates.  This is untrue.  Everyone can be hypnotized.  It's simply that a 2-6 second instant induction either doesn't work on you OR that your compatibility with that particular hypnotist isn't good enough.  Try different people.  I don't have perfect luck with everyone either, but those I don't, I refer to other friends, and there are no problems.  It is NOT you.  The cost is whatever cover there is to attend the show.</p><br>

        <h3>Seeing a hypnotherapist</h3><br><br>
        <p class="negativeMargin">This is by far the most expensive option, but you'll be working with someone in person, in a quiet setting, who has a hypnotherapy certification, and most likely also a doctorate in psychology or psychiatry.  This is also the least fun option, but if you have problems, this is the best option to follow.
        </p><br>
        
        <h3>Working with a (street) hypnotist in person, over the phone, or even in text messages only!</h3><br><br>
        <p class="negativeMargin">In person is by far the fastest way, ranging from 2-6 seconds to 20 minutes, depending on your focus ability; everyone is different.  Over the phone is typically 10 minutes - 30 minutes.  Text message and instant messaging chat features ARE possible.  However, it can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours of consistent interaction.  This option is usually free.  Technically, I am a street hypnotist.  I do fun and entertaining spectacles with subjects but I don't charge money for my time.  The homepage has a short video of an instant <a href="../index.html">induction</a> I did with a volunteer.  Instant inductions can take as few as 2 seconds to 2 minutes.  The remaining 3 galleries here are photos I can use to either confuse or over-focus a subject.
