          <dt><strong>Observe Their Basic Demeanor</strong></dt>
          <dd>
            Everyone tends to wear their emotions on their face all the time, whether they know it or not.  Someone whose facial expressions are closed down is demonstrating a defensiveness towards interaction with anyone.  If there's a smile on their face, we can usually tell if it's forced or genuine.  Is their posture relaxed, or tense?  Are they facing you straight on, or more diagonally?  Imagine yourself facing someone directly, then do the same but be standing at an angle from them.  It's easier to trust someone who is facing you.

          <dt><strong>Ask Some Simple Questions that will have the Subject Saying Yes</strong></dt>
          <dd>
            We tend to trust another person the more we agree, or say yes, to what they ask us.  By simple, I don't mean 'is it daytime' when the sun is out.  It's important to make the questions slightly personal, to engender trust from the subject.  Perhaps something along the lines of (with a genuine smile on their face) 'I see you're quite happy or excited about the idea of something, yes?' (makes the subject focus even more on their happy mental topic) then, 'Do you usually feel even more excited when you are so focused on an idea that makes you happy?'.
          </dd>
            <dt><strong>Mental Observations to Lead You into What to Say Next...</strong></dt>
          <dd>
            You have taken note of their activities that say 'openness'.  You have a general idea of their demeanor.  You have asked at least 4 questions regarding that facial expression that has them in a good mood towards you specifically, and that they have answered 'yes' to, every time.
          </dd>
          <dd>
            You have probably noticed that they have also performed a few more of the Openness / Yes possibilities as soon as their trust level unconsciously increased.  You are doing well so far in this easy and relaxed conversation.</dd>
            <dt><strong>Here is a simple checklist that is easy to memorize.</strong></dt>
            <dd>Look.  Listen.  Pay attention.</dd>

            <tr><td class="textCenter">Happy/Excited</td><td class="text">Acknowledge their happiness in a question to make them focus more.  Present a comparable situation that leads to more focus, on a similar topic.</td><td class="textCenter">4</td></tr>
            <tr><td class="textCenter">Sad</td><td class="text">Ask if this is a good time for them.  Would it be easier on their minds to share the problem.  Listen.  Pay attention to the subject's facial expressions.</td><td class="textCenter">6</td></tr>
            <tr><td class="textCenter">Angry</td><td class="text">Watch how they sit down.  Make a confusing statement to divert their attention and interrupt their focus, for 1 second, then tell the subject to think about a fun time in the past 10 years.  Count to 10 silently.  Ask the subject to think about a fun time in the past year.  Count to 10 again.  Move to Happy.</td><td class="textCenter">6</td></tr>
            <tr><td class="textCenter">No Visible Emotion</td><td class="text">Ask the subject to count backwards, out loud, by sevens, from 100.  After 3-5 replies, say, 'now, up by nines.'  After 2 replies, say, 'now down by sixes.' While they are counting, tell the subject to think of a fun time in the past year.  Move to happy.</td><td class="textCenter">3</td></tr>
