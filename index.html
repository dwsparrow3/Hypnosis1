          Have you ever driven to and from a regular location, for example home and work, following the same route there and back, and found yourself occasionally seeming to fall asleep as soon as you get to the end of your road, and awakening in a great parking spot at work?
        <br><br>
          Have you ever gotten lost while reading a book, watching a movie, or a tv show, and someone tapped you on the shoulder to get your attention?  Were you startled for a couple seconds before your eyes refocused on the person, and you had to ask what they wanted?
        <br><br>
          Those experiences are autohypnosis, and <strong>you</strong> did them to <strong>yourself</strong>.
        </p>
          <h2>What are some of the possibilities I can experience?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Full Relaxation, from the hair on your head, to the tips of your toes</li>
          <li>Being free from phobias</li>
          <li>Ending behaviors that you deem harmful to your own well-being</li>
          <li>Becoming your opinion of what someone else is like</li>
          <li>Having fun!</li>
